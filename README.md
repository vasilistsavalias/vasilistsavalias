# Bill Tsav
**MSc AI & Data Analytics — University of Macedonia**  
Computer Science background ∙ AI/ML researcher ∙ AI education consultant

## TL;DR
I build reproducible ML pipelines and research-grade models for real problems (image restoration, wildfire detection, synthetic data & privacy). I teach practical AI from kids (10–15) to undergrads. Currently finishing an MSc and contributing to EU-funded AI/ML projects.

> Going back to my shire to grow a garden like Bilbo — but first: automate everything and ship reliable ML.

## What I do (no fluff)
- **Research & applied ML:** synthetic data, federated learning, model evaluation, transfer learning  
- **Computer vision:** image restoration, smoke/wildfire detection, dataset curation  
- **Data engineering:** reproducible pipelines, ETL, model ops (Docker + CI)  
- **Education & outreach:** designed full AI curriculum (ages 10–15) — ethics, Scratch → Python → Teachable Machine

## Selected projects (replace links)
- **wildfire-smoke-detection** — preprocessing, augmentation pipeline, YOLO/RetinaNet recipes. `github.com/you/wildfire-smoke-detection`  
- **synthetic-data-secured** — tabular & image synthetic generators + privacy evaluation. `github.com/you/synthetic-data-secured`  
- **teachable-ai-curriculum** — lesson plans & interactive demos for 10–15 y/o. `github.com/you/teachable-ai-curriculum`

## Quick setup tips (for maintainers)
1. Add 3 pinned repos: (research, applied project, teaching).  
2. Add badges: build status, languages, GitHub actions. Example badge markup:  
   `![build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/you/repo/ci.yml)`  
3. Add 1-line metric under each project if available (dataset size, delta vs baseline, deployment notes).
