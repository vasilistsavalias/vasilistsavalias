### 👋 Hello there,

I’m an **AI Researcher** and **MSc Candidate in AI & Data Analytics** at the University of Macedonia. I build applied ML systems for EU-funded research projects, moving from "it runs on my machine" to reproducible, deployed pipelines.

- 🎓 **Current focus:** Synthetic Data Generation (GANs/TVAE) · Predictive Modeling · Web Mining · MLOps · Full Stack (Next.js, FastAPI, Tailwind).
- 🔬 **Research:** Researcher at **Datalab (AUTH)** , currently engineering AI for **Skillscapes** (Greece 2.0) . Lead author of a GDM diagnosis framework (under review at ACM JDIQ).
- 🏫 **Education & Outreach:** AI Education Consultant for **Axion Schools**. Designed a full 5-year AI curriculum for ages 10–15 (Ethics, Scratch → Teachable Machine → Python).
- 🤝 **Leadership:** Former Coordinator for the **IEEE Student Branch**. Mentored 40+ students in Python and competitive programming.

> I'd rather be chilling in the Shire growing my garden, but alas,we live in a society...

**Interests:** Socializing, guitar, history, gaming, movies, board games, and carbonated water.
