### 👋 Hi — I’m Bill
I’m pursuing an **MSc in AI & Data Analytics** at the University of Macedonia (BSc in Computer Science, same uni). I work on applied AI/ML in EU-funded research projects and build reproducible pipelines and models for real problems.

- 🎓 **Current focus:** synthetic data generation · historical artifact restoration (master’s thesis) · ETL · CI/CD pipelines  
- 🔬 **Research:** member of the university AI/ML research team — contributor on EU-funded projects (synthetic data, privacy-preserving methods, vision tasks)  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Education & outreach:** AI Education Consultant for Axion Schools in my hometown — designed a full AI curriculum for ages 10–15 (problem-based learning, AI ethics, Scratch → Teachable Machine → Python)  
- 🤝 **Leadership:** volunteered as Coordinator, IEEE Student Branch — taught Python and mentored student projects

> I like programming — but I’d much rather be chilling in the Shire and growing my garden.

**Interests:**  socializing, guitar, history, gaming, marathon running
